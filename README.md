# I2C Communication using the PIC18F4520 and external EEPROM

A simple I2C project that implements a simple communication between the PIC18F4520 and the 24AA1025 (I2C EEPROM).

The project consists of storing data into the EEPROM and reading it back using the I2C module. More specifically, you are going to store the value 0x07 in address 0x00 of the EEPROM and then read it back.
